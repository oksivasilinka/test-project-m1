# Test Project

This project serves as a technical test assignment. It contains several bugs and missing behaviors that need to be identified and fixed. Your main objectives are to:
 
- Make the project run.
- Fix bugs related to functionality and rendering.
- Propose enhancements to the existing logic, code, and project (implementation optional, but a detailed description is required). 

> 👉 Clone the repository to your local machine, create a new repository on your preferred platform, and push your solution there. Share a link to your completed solution. All your work, findings, and suggestions should be documented in a Markdown file named SOLUTION_REPORT.md
